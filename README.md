# Configuration file for crafted-emacs

Dave Wilson, Jeff Bowman, and others have built [crafted-emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs).
This is an Emacs profile that tries to maximize the use of the built-in features of Emacs while minimizing the use of packages.
It already has an autocompletion system so avoid another one.

I had to install the JetBeans fonts on my Mac OS.
Now it has the look and feel of Dave Wilson's setup on System Crafters.
You get to become a cool kid without much effort!

Crafted-emacs is a framework on which to build further customizations.
It is for advanced beginners and beyond.
You need some experience with configuration files: probably more experience than is required to use scimax where a many packages that an academic needs are built-in.

The user's configuratoin resides in the top directory of *~/.crafted-emacs* in *config.el*.
I copied over my configuration in *user.el* from scimax and the configuration for yasnippets from *init.el* in latex-emacs.
I have too much invested in yasnippets to abandon it right now.

I had to install the following:

- use-package
- atomic-chrome
- yasnippets
